# Next.js 15 Client-Side Data Fetching Delay and UX Improvement

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 applications involving client-side data fetching and proposes a solution to improve the user experience.

## Problem

The `pages/about.js` component fetches data using `useEffect` with a simulated 3-second delay.  This creates a noticeable delay for users before the content appears. The lack of a loading indicator further exacerbates this problem.

## Solution

The `pages/aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates an improved approach that includes:

1. **Loading indicator:** A visual indicator informs the user that data is being fetched.
2. **Suspense:** If available (React 18+), Suspense can be used to handle asynchronous data more gracefully.  This ensures that the loading indicator is displayed while data fetching takes place.  If not available, the loading indicator alone is a good alternative. 

This revised approach provides a smoother and more user-friendly experience.
